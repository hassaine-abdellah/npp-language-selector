# Language Selector

## plugin for Notepad++
### Description
Notepad++ allows you to manually choose the current language (and associated syntax highlighting) from the tab menu, or when you save the fill according to that extension,\
But very often, you will need to set the language and see the highlighting of code on new files *before* you save them, and without going each time to the menu and choosing the language.\
This plug-in allows you to do that easily, and in addition, to access your favourite/most-used languages in a quick manner.
### Features
• Select programming language from drop-down menu.\
• Auto-show selection dialogue on new tabs (can be turned off).\
• Pin favourite languages on top of the list for quick access (when favourites are full, the oldest one (first in) is put out).\
• Configurable favourite list size.\
