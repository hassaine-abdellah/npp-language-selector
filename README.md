# Language Selector

## plugin for Notepad++
### Description
Notepad++ allows you to manually choose the current programming language from the tab menu, or when you save the fill according to that extension.\
But very often, you need to set the language and see the syntax highlighting of code on new files *before* you save them, and without going each time to the menu to choose the language.\
This plug-in allows you to do that, and in addition, to access your favourite/most-used languages in a quick manner.
### Features
• Select programming language from drop-down menu.\
• Auto-show selection dialogue on new tabs (can be turned off).\
• Pin favourite languages on top of the list for quick access (when favourites are full, the oldest one (first in) is put out).\
• Configurable favourite list size.
### How to use
For **64-bit** computers, decompress the archive ***Language_Selector_v1.0_x64.7z*** from the release section, and copy the folder inside (***Language Selector***) to the ***plugins*** directory of Notepad++ main folder.\
The same goes for older **32-bit** computers, but using the ***Language_Selector_v1.0_x86.7z*** file instead.
